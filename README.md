This repository contains the analysis and visualization code for studying gut and respiratory microbiomes based on the KLZ cohort. Most of the plotting and data processing scripts are presented within RMarkdown files, providing a comprehensive and reproducible workflow for the research. 

Feel free to explore, use, or adapt the code for similar microbiome studies. Contributions and discussions are welcome!
